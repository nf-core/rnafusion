## Introduction

**nf-core/rnafusion** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for RNA sequencing consisting of several tools designed for detecting and visualizing fusion genes. Results from up to 5 fusion callers tools are created, and are also aggregated, most notably in a pdf visualiation document, a vcf data collection file, and html and tsv reports.

On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources. The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/rnafusion/results).

In rnafusion the full-sized test includes reference building and fusion detection. The test dataset is taken from [here](https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/tree/rnafusion/testdata/human).

## Pipeline summary

![nf-core/rnafusion metro map](docs/images/nf-core-rnafusion_metro_map.png)

### Build references

`--build_references` triggers a parallel workflow to build references, which is a prerequisite to running the pipeline:

1. Download ensembl fasta and gtf files
2. Create [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) index
3. Download [Arriba](https://github.com/suhrig/arriba) references
4. Download [FusionCatcher](https://github.com/ndaniel/fusioncatcher) references
5. Download and build [STAR-Fusion](https://github.com/STAR-Fusion/STAR-Fusion) references
6. Download [Fusion-report](https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/fusion-report) DBs

#### Main workflow

1. Input samplesheet check
2. Concatenate fastq files per sample ([cat](http://www.linfo.org/cat.html))
3. Reads quality control ([FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))
4. Optional trimming with [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp)
5. Arriba subworkflow
   - [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) alignment
   - [Arriba](https://github.com/suhrig/arriba) fusion detection
6. STAR-fusion subworkflow
   - [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) alignment
   - [STAR-Fusion](https://github.com/STAR-Fusion/STAR-Fusion) fusion detection
7. Fusioncatcher subworkflow
   - [FusionCatcher](https://github.com/ndaniel/fusioncatcher) fusion detection
8. StringTie subworkflow
   - [StringTie](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/)
9. Fusion-report
   - Merge all fusions detected by the selected tools with [Fusion-report](https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/fusion-report)
10. Post-processing and analysis of data
    - [FusionInspector](https://github.com/FusionInspector/FusionInspector)
    - [Arriba](https://github.com/suhrig/arriba) visualisation
    - Collect metrics ([`picard CollectRnaSeqMetrics`](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037057492-CollectRnaSeqMetrics-Picard-), [`picard CollectInsertSizeMetrics`](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037055772-CollectInsertSizeMetrics-Picard-) and ([`picard MarkDuplicates`](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037052812-MarkDuplicates-Picard-))
11. Present QC for raw reads ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))
12. Compress bam files to cram with [samtools view](http://www.htslib.org/)

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

As the reference building is computationally heavy (> 24h on HPC), it is recommended to test the pipeline with the `-stub` parameter (creation of empty files):

First, build the references:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/rnafusion \
   -profile test,<docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>\
   --build_references \
   -stub
```

Then perform the analysis:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/rnafusion \
   -profile test,<docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>\
   -stub
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

> **Notes:**
>
> - Conda is not currently supported; run with singularity or docker.
> - Paths need to be absolute.
> - GRCh38 is the only supported reference.
> - Single-end reads are to be used as last-resort. Paired-end reads are recommended. FusionCatcher cannot be used with single-end reads shorter than 130 bp.

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/rnafusion/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/rnafusion/parameters).
