## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## Pipeline overview <!-- omit in toc -->

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/)
and processes data using the following steps:

## Arriba

**Output directory: `results/tools/Arriba`**

- `fusions.tsv`
  - contains fusions which pass all of Arriba's filters. It should be highly enriched for true predictions. The predictions are listed from highest to lowest confidence.
- `fusions.discarded.tsv`
  - contains all events that Arriba classified as an artifact or that are also observed in healthy tissue. This file may be useful, if one suspects that an event should be present, but was erroneously discarded by Arriba.
- `<sample>.pdf`
  - contains fusion visualization when opted for `--arriba_vis`

## EricScript

**Output directory: `results/tools/Ericscript/tmp`**

- `fusions.results.filtered.tsv`
  - contains all the predicted gene fusions

## FastQC

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) gives general quality metrics about your sequenced reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, per base sequence content (%A/T/G/C), adapter contamination and overrepresented sequences.

For further reading and documentation see the [FastQC help pages](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/).

**Output files:**

> **NB:** The FastQC plots displayed in the MultiQC report shows _untrimmed_ reads.
> They may contain adapter sequence and potentially regions with low quality.

- `fastqc/`
  - `*_fastqc.html`: FastQC report containing quality metrics for your untrimmed raw fastq files.
- `fastqc/zips/`
  - `*_fastqc.zip`: Zip archive containing the FastQC report, tab-delimited data file and plot images.

## Fusioncatcher

**Output directory: `results/tools/Fusioncatcher`**

  - contains all the predicted gene fusions

| Column | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Gene\_1\_symbol(5end\_fusion\_partner)** | Gene symbol of the 5' end fusion partner |
| **Gene\_2\_symbol\_2(3end\_fusion\_partner)** | Gene symbol of the 3' end fusion partner |
| **Gene\_1\_id(5end\_fusion\_partner)** | Ensembl gene id of the 5' end fusion partner |
| **Gene\_2\_id(3end\_fusion\_partner)** | Ensembl gene id of the 3' end fusion partner |
| **Exon\_1\_id(5end\_fusion\_partner)** | Ensembl exon id of the 5' end fusion exon-exon junction |
| **Exon\_2\_id(3end\_fusion\_partner)** | Ensembl exon id of the 3' end fusion exon-exon junction |
| **Fusion\_point\_for\_gene\_1(5end\_fusion\_partner)** | Chromosomal position of the 5' end of fusion junction (chromosome:position:strand); 1-based coordinate |
| **Fusion\_point\_for\_gene\_2(3end\_fusion\_partner)** | Chromosomal position of the 3' end of fusion junction (chromosome:position:strand); 1-based coordinate |
| **Spanning\_pairs** | Count of pairs of reads supporting the fusion (**including** also the multimapping reads) |
| **Spanning\_unique\_reads** | Count of unique reads (i.e. unique mapping positions) mapping on the fusion junction. Shortly, here are counted all the reads which map on fusion junction minus the PCR duplicated reads. |
| **Longest\_anchor\_found** | Longest anchor (hangover) found among the unique reads mapping on the fusion junction |
| **Fusion\_finding\_method** | Aligning method used for mapping the reads and finding the fusion genes. Here are the methods used: |
| | (i) **BOWTIE** = only Bowtie aligner is used for mapping the reads on the genome and exon-exon fusion junctions |
| | (ii) **BOWTIE+BLAT** = Bowtie aligner is used for mapping reads on the genome and BLAT is used for mapping reads for finding the fusion junction |
| | (iii) **BOWTIE+STAR** = Bowtie aligner is used for mapping reads on the genome and STAR is used for mapping reads for finding the fusion junction |
| | (iv) **BOWTIE+BOWTIE2** = Bowtie aligner is used for mapping reads on the genome and Bowtie2 is used for mapping reads for finding the fusion junction |

| **Fusion\_description** | Type of the fusion gene (see the Table 2) |
| **Counts\_of\_common\_mapping\_reads** | Count of reads mapping simultaneously on both genes which form the fusion gene. This is an indication how similar are the DNA/RNA sequences of the genes forming the fusion gene (i.e. what is their homology because highly homologous genes tend to appear show as candidate fusion genes). In case of completely different sequences of the genes involved in forming a fusion gene then here it is expected to have the value zero. |
| **Predicted\_effect** | Predicted effect of the candidate fusion gene using the annotation from Ensembl database. This is shown in format **effect\_gene\_1**/**effect\_gene\_2**, where the possible values for effect\_gene\_1 or effect\_gene\_2 are: **intergenic**, **intronic**, **exonic(no-known-CDS)**, **UTR**, **CDS(not-reliable-start-or-end)**, **CDS(truncated)**, or **CDS(complete)**. In case that the fusion junction for both genes is within their CDS (coding sequence) then only the values **in-frame** or **out-of-frame** will be shown. |
| **Predicted\_fused\_transcripts** | All possible known fused transcripts in format ENSEMBL-TRANSCRIPT-1:POSITION-1/ENSEMBLE-TRANSCRIPT-B:POSITION-2, where are fused the sequence 1:POSITION-1 of transcript ENSEMBL-TRANSCRIPT-1 with sequence POSITION-2:END of transcript ENSEMBL-TRANSCRIPT-2 |
| **Predicted\_fused\_proteins** | Predicted amino acid sequences of all possible fused proteins (separated by ";").  |

To visualize fusion genes in [IGV tool](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/igvtools) first create a genome `Menu->Genomes->Create .genome File`, choose name and description, then choose the following files:

- `finspector.fa`
  - make sure the index file finspector.fa.fai is in the same folder
- `finspector.gtf`
  - use this for 'Genes'
- `cytoBand.txt`
  - use this for 'optional Cytoband'

Add the bam files by choosing `File->Load from File` and make sure to select your generated mini genome in the upper-left corner.

## MultiQC

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarizing all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability.

For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see [https://multiqc.info](https://multiqc.info).

**Output files:**

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
  - `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

## Pipeline information

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.

**Output files:**

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.csv`.
  - Documentation for interpretation of results in HTML format: `results_description.html`.
